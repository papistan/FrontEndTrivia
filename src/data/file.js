There are three: \n -Global Variables − A global variable has global scope which means it is visible everywhere in your JavaScript code.\n-Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined.

          'Lexical Scoping describes how a parser resolves variable names when functions are nested. \nThe word "lexical" refers to the fact that lexical scoping uses the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available. \nE.G. Nested functions have access to variables declared in their outer scope.'
